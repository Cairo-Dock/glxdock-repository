TITLE: Cairo-Dock 3 is now available!
** Cairo-Dock 3.0: a slick user-friendly desktop interface. **
 
It sits in the center of your desktop, allowing you to monitor and control your favorite apps: music players, chat messengers, twitter, torrents downloaders, RSS feeds, calendar/tasks, weather, mail checkers, etc. It also features a powerful taskbar.
 
It presents you the information and controls in form of docks, desktop widgets and panels, and lets you customize them as much as you may wish, so that your desktop will be definitely unique and fits _your_ needs.
 
Customization is very easy, and a lot of themes are already available.
** Strong points **
 
Unlike some new "modern" shells, Cairo-Dock comes with the usual features you expect on a desktop :

* A **powerful taskbar** that lets you group and reorder windows in the dock, close and open a new instance in one click, switch between windows of the same application using the mouse scroll, etc.

** How to install it **

Cairo-Dock 3.0 is available in Ubuntu Precise's repositories. For any other distribution, please see http://www.glx-dock.org/ww_page.php?p=Accueil&lang=en#0-Installation.

* Cairo-dock works with any Window Manager, runs on any hardware (even old netbooks), can use the graphic card to be very smooth or a fallback mode if the drivers don't support it, is very well integrated with the most common desktop environments, and is actively developed. 
That means you can use Cairo-Dock as a shell with your current configuration, your current apps, your current theme; you don't need to change everything, or even learn a new paradigm. Make the dock works as you want, not the opposite ;-)
